## Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Invalid Reference in ESPN Module**
**Issue:**  
The application crashed when listing upcoming games because of a typo (`N.one` instead of `None`) inside the `espn.py` file.  

**Solution:**  
Updated the conditional check to use `if dates is not None:` to correctly handle null values.

### 2. **Stale Pending Bets Not Updating**
**Issue:**  
Settled games were still showing as `PENDING` in the bet list.  

**Solution:**  
Added calls to `check_and_settle()` during initialization and before viewing slips to automatically update settled bets and display accurate statuses.

### 3. **User Bet Management**
**Issue:**  
Users could not manage their own bet slips effectively â€” canceled bets still appeared in the list or were locked incorrectly.  

**Solution:**  
Implemented a cancel feature inside `settlement_service` that allows users to remove a slip **only if no legs are underway**, ensuring integrity once games start.

### 4. **Slip Visibility and Organization**
**Issue:**  
The system displayed all slips in one view, making it hard to track current vs settled bets.  

**Solution:**  
Created three separate viewing actions:
- `View Current Slips (Pending)`
- `View Settled Slips (Won/Lost)`
- `View All Slips`  
This separation improved clarity and user experience.

### 5. **Data Synchronization at Startup**
**Issue:**  
When the program started, previously settled slips were not being reflected correctly in the database.  

**Solution:**  
Added an automatic settlement check in `init_db_and_wallet()` to ensure the wallet and slips are up-to-date upon program launch.
